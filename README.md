# BrickOut

## Background
BrickOut is inspired by the video game Breakout. Breakout was released by Atari in 1976. The player controls a paddle that can only travel horizontally along the bottom of the screen. There are 8 rows of bricks near the top of the screen. The player must bounce a ball from the paddle and hit each brick to clear them. The ball bounces off of each surface except the bottom of the screen. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a paddle. The player has 2 paddles in reserve, with 3 total. Once the player no longer has any of the paddles, the player loses. The player passes the level when all the bricks are cleared.

## Functionality & MVP
In BrickOut, the user is able to:
- [ ] Start, pause, or reset the game
- [ ] Move the paddle with the left/right arrows, or direct the paddle using the mouse
- [ ] Bounce the ball by placing the paddle in the ball's path
- [ ] Clear bricks when in contact with the bouncing ball

This project will also include:
- [ ] A modal describing the rules of BrickOut
- [ ] A production README

## Wireframes
This project will have the game title at the top of the window. In the middle will be the game screen. Below the game will be a picture of the controls and a button to open a How To Play modal. The modal will explain the game rules and power-ups (see Bonus Features). Next to the controls will be links to my LinkedIn and Github.
